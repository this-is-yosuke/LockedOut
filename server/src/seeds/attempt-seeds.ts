/* Based on folder 20, it looks like intermediary tables neither have model data nor seed data. The mentioned files
   might be deleted later. Dani confirmed that model and seed data are not necessary because of sequelize. HOWEVER,
   if we wanted to add something a little extra to a table that just has a couple of IDs, then we'd need those files.
   I will keep the attempt model for now, but the attempt seeds are not needed presently.*/
